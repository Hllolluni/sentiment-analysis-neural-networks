This repository implements Artificial Neural Networks(ANN) for determining the sentiment of the Movie Reviews(positive or negative).
The available dataset(Movie Reviews - IMDB dataset) is provided by keras datasets. This dataset contains 25,000 highly polar movie reviews (good or bad) for training and the same amount 
again for testing. The data was collected by Stanford researchers in 2011.
